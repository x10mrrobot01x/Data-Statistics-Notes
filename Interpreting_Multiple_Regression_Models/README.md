### Multiple Regression Analysis

#### 1. Overall Model Significance (F-test)
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: β1 = β2 = 0 (Both slope coefficients are zero, implying weight and horsepower have no effect on MPG.)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**: At least one βi ≠ 0 (At least one of the slope coefficients is not zero, suggesting weight or horsepower or both have an impact on MPG.)
- **Level of significance**: 0.05
- **Test statistic (F-statistic)**: 69.00
- **P-value (Prob (F-statistic))**: 2.44e-11

Given that the p-value is much less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This implies that at least one of the predictors (weight or horsepower) is statistically significant in predicting MPG.

#### 2. Weight Variable Analysis
- **Slope coefficient for the weight variable**: -3.6050
- This coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level of significance (P-value < 0.05). This suggests that weight is a significant predictor of MPG.

#### 3. Horsepower Variable Analysis
- **Slope coefficient for the horsepower variable**: -0.0398
- This coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level of significance (P-value < 0.05). This indicates that horsepower is a significant predictor of MPG.

#### 4. Comparison of F-test and Individual t-tests
- The overall F-test determines whether at least one of the predictors is statistically significant in the regression model. On the other hand, individual t-tests ascertain if each predictor variable is individually statistically significant. In essence, the F-test assesses the joint significance of all predictor variables, while the t-tests evaluate the significance of each predictor variable separately.

#### 5. Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)
- The coefficient of determination (R-squared) for the model is 0.836. This suggests that approximately 83.6% of the variation in MPG can be explained by the weight and horsepower of the cars in the model. Given that this is a relatively high R-squared value, it indicates a good fit of the model to the data.

---

In conclusion, both weight and horsepower are significant predictors of MPG. The overall model is significant and explains a substantial portion of the variation in MPG.
